I believe that everyone is equal and everyone deserves the same resources.

	Resources is another amazing way to donate. This way of donation is very important because it could save someone's life. While we are having 3 meals a day people are starving wishing for a piece of bread. That is why I encourage you to donate some of your resources. Even the small things like donating a bag of clothes to goodwill will help a lot. So when thinking of throwing away a shirt that doesn't fit think twice and donate it!</h4>
